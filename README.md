# Player Recognition ML Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a machine learning model for player recognition in images. The model is trained to classify images of sports players into different categories based on the player depicted. The project encompasses data cleaning, model development, and deployment with a full-fledged website incorporating both frontend and backend components.
